# Mirah's Dotfiles

![Image of my terminal](screenshot.png)

This exists primarily for the purposes of backing up my config, especially after I lost all my zsh config once in the middle of customizing it.

## Setup

Clone the repo, then run `make setup`
```
git clone git@github.com:MirahImage/dotfiles.git && \
    cd dotfiles && \
    make setup
```
